# Web Game Hacking
A collection of scripts to modify various web games

# How to use?
1. Find the script you want in [/Scripts](/Scripts)
2. If you (for good reason) dont trust blindly what I say, take a look at the script. I do my best to keep them commented.
3. Copy the contents (All scripts are designed to be copy and paste
4. Open the website
5. Open devtools in your browser. (This can be different for different browsers but generally, right click and press inspect or press ^C (Ctrl+Shift+c))
6. Paste in the code that you have copied. (This can sometimes require you to type "allow pasting")
7. Reap the benefits of the mod
